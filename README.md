This library was dead easy to use. Python is NOT my native language, and isn't even in my top 10. Yet I found using the library very intuitive. The naming of the methods was straight-forward and consistent. I found a problem with passing integers to the division function where a real value would be expected. Because the library author just used native math methods, he got native behavior, which truncated to an integer result.

I was able to use the code without any modification whatsoever.
